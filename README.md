# backgroundTask

This is an updated Swift version of the example of the Infinite Running Background Task
http://hayageek.com/ios-long-running-background-task/ that was written in objective C
Infinite task is based on playing blank audio file
My version is simplified to a minumum to run the task forever in the background
I also included a blank wav file that will be played forever until you stop the task
